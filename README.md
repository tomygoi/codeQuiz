# codeQuiz

##Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This challenge was presented to have us create a quiz about coding from scratch. This would implement many of the javascript concepts introduced throughout the past week during class. For example, local storage, DOM traversal, arrays, etc.

##Usage 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The coding quiz can be accessed via [https://tomygoi.github.io/codeQuiz/] The current quiz is currently not functioning correctly in some aspects, but users will be able to click the start button and see how the program is beginning to function correctly. Questions will be updated.
